## Custom Design
All Timbersmiths timber frames start at the design process either working with individual owners, architects or contractors. It is exciting to start the process and sit down with the client and help them realize their dreams and fulfill their aspirations. The timber frames that we design represent more to our customer's than just a home. They tend to be a lasting legacy, beautifully achieved for generations to enjoy. We want your custom hand-crafted timber frame home to be a rewarding endeavor for our customers. From a customer's simple sketch we begin an exciting process where anything is possible. We can take an architectural drawing and develop it into a stunning timber frame. The design process is the most critical phase of a project. With Timbersmiths engineering background and years of experience designing and hand-crafting timber frames we can guide you through one of the most rewarding journeys of a lifetime. The results are a custom designed, hand-crafted heirloom. All designs are in a 3D CAD format.

## General Contracting
Timbersmiths, Inc. is a licensed Class A General Contractor giving our clients flexibility and security during the entire construction process. We can provide turn-key projects that are on time and on budget. Working with Architects, Developers and Sub-Contractors as well as directly with Home Owners Timbersmiths can administrate an entire construction project.

## Project Management
Starting with our Design Team and continuing with our Civil and Structural Engineering we can share administrative responsibilities to keep a project under budget and on time.

## Timber Framing & Installation
Our Timber Frames start as a design concept and are brought to life from logs to timbers to handcrafted components. All joinery is done in-house with the utmost attention to detail utilizing traditional hand tools and modern power tools for the finished product. Test assembly is performed before shipment and final assembly and installation is completed at the jobsite. Commonly, our timber frames include a full enclosure option so additional work can be easily completed by other trades.

## Historic Restoration
We love old timber frames that need TLC. Timbersmiths can turn a historically rich building into a useful asset with renewed purpose. Our projects have included historic barns, stables, warehouses and homes. Either as the general contractor or as a sub-contractor Timbersmiths provides capable knowledge and appreciation for historic properties. Extending the useful life of an important structure utilizes our skills with new construction combined with our knowledge of historic building practices. This gives added context, insight and inspiration for the legacy's that our timber frames provide.

## Building Redesign, Repurposing & Transformation
With many of our historic projects the use of the buildings may evolve to accommodate a new purpose. This can include transforming a property in to a public space such as a municipal, commercial or residential building. This requires the need for reengineering to accommodate zoning and building codes. With our in-house engineering and design capabilities we provide expertise for repurposing, usually working directly with architects and providing the skill and craft that such projects require.
